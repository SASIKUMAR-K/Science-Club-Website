They do this by bringing the joy of learning straight to the pupils with the aid of committed volunteers and a mobile classroom. Every mile travelled is a step towards a society where people are better informed and in control. The mobile laboratory for education and exploration!Education on the go. Where we used to go to the school, pick up the kids, and teach them science activities in the bus itself at the elementary level. Aside from that, we are teaching women about empowerment and the distinctions between touching well and badly. At the end of the session, the manner the children handled us was delightful. These were wonderful days to remember.",
